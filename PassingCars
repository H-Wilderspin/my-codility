<!-- Analogy / metaphor is bullshit. It hinders more than helps.

A:

0 
1
0
1
1

for every 0 count the 1's that follow it:

0
1 x
0 
1 x x 
1 x x

= 5

Write an algorithm that does this. Pref O(n)
 -->

function solution(A) {
   
    let count = 0
    let total = 0

    for(let i = A.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){

        if(A[i] === 1){
            count++
        }
        else{
            total = total + count
        }
        if(total > 1000000000){return -1}
    }

    return total

}

<!-- 
Solution:

- Take the length of the array - 1, 
- Use it as the index as you iterate over the array backwards,
- Decrementing it by 1 on each sweep. 

if A[i] === 1, increment a counter
if 0, add counter to total. 
DO NOT reset the count, you need the cumulative total

return total at the end of the loop
